## ⚠️ Remaining Issues

### Issue 1: Product Card Not Saving on First Selection
**Problem:** When a customer selects a product for the first time on the main website messaging page, it sends automatically but doesn't save to the database.

**Location:** `app/messaging/page.tsx` or `components/live-chat.tsx`

**Fix Needed:** Check the product card sending logic to ensure it's properly saving to Supabase messages table.

### Issue 2: Real-Time Updates
**Problem:** Both messaging pages (customer and admin) require manual refresh to see new messages.

**Solution Needed:** Implement Supabase real-time subscriptions:
- Subscribe to messages table changes
- Auto-update when new messages arrive
- Show typing indicators (optional)
- Play notification sound (optional)

## Technical Stack Used
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Real-time:** Supabase Realtime (needs implementation)
- **Language:** Farsi (RTL support)
- **Currency:** Afghani throughout

## Database Tables Used
- `customers` - Customer information
- `orders` - Order data with status
