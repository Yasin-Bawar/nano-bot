# ✅ User Session System Implemented!

## How It Works

Your website now has a **persistent user session** system without requiring login!

### 🔐 Session Flow

1. **User Completes Checkout**
   - Name, phone, location saved to database
   - Customer ID and Order ID generated
   - Info stored in browser's localStorage

2. **User Can Access Messaging Anytime**
   - No need to login again
   - System remembers their info
   - Can send messages freely

3. **Session Persists**
   - Survives page refresh
   - Survives browser close/reopen
   - Only clears when user logs out
