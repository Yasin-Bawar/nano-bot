# üöÄ Home Page Settings - Installation Steps

## Prerequisites
- ‚úÖ Supabase project set up
- ‚úÖ Admin system configured

## Step-by-Step Installation

### Step 1: Execute SQL Schema ‚ö°

1. Open your Supabase Dashboard
2. Go to **SQL Editor**
3. Click **New Query**
4. Copy the entire content from `home-settings-schema.sql`
5. Paste into the SQL Editor
6. Click **Run** or press `Ctrl+Enter`

**Expected Output:**
```
‚úÖ Home Page Settings Schema Created Successfully!
üìã Tables created:
   - home_hero_settings
   - home_features
   - home_section_settings
   - home_settings_audit_log
üîí RLS policies configured
üì¶ Storage bucket "home-images" configured
‚ú® Default data inserted
```

### Step 2: Verify Installation ‚úì

Run this query to verify tables were created:

```sql
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name LIKE 'home_%'
ORDER BY table_name;
```

**Expected Result:**
```
home_features
home_hero_settings
home_section_settings
home_settings_audit_log
```

### Step 3: Check Default Data üìä

Verify default data was inserted:

```sql
-- Check hero settings
SELECT * FROM home_hero_settings;

-- Check features
SELECT * FROM home_features ORDER BY order_index;

-- Check section settings
SELECT * FROM home_section_settings;
```

### Step 4: Verify Storage Bucket üóÇÔ∏è

1. Go to **Storage** in Supabase Dashboard
2. Look for bucket named `home-images`
3. Verify it's set to **Public**

If bucket doesn't exist, create it manually:
```sql
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public)
VALUES ('home-images', 'home-images', true)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;
```

### Step 5: Test Admin Access üîê

1. Start your Next.js development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

2. Login to admin panel:
```

2. Go to admin home settings
3. Upload image in Hero Section
4. Check Supabase Storage:
   - Go to Storage ‚Üí home-images
   - Your image should be there
5. Refresh home page
6. New image should appear in hero section

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: SQL Execution Fails

**Error:** `relation "admin_users" does not exist`

**Solution:** Make sure admin system is set up first. Run `admin-schema.sql` before this schema.

---

**Error:** `bucket "home-images" already exists`

**Solution:** This is fine! The bucket already exists. Continue with installation.

---

**Error:** `permission denied for table`

**Solution:** Make sure you're running SQL as the database owner or with sufficient privileges.

### Issue: Admin Page Shows 404

**Solution:** 
1. Check file exists: `app/admin/home-settings/page.tsx`
2. Restart Next.js dev server
3. Clear `.next` cache: `rm -rf .next`

### Issue: Images Not Uploading

**Solution:**
1. Check storage bucket exists and is public
2. Verify RLS policies on `storage.objects`
3. Check file size (keep under 5MB)
4. Try different image format (JPG, PNG, WebP)

### Issue: Changes Not Appearing on Home Page

**Solution:**
1. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify settings saved in database:
```sql
SELECT * FROM home_hero_settings;
```

### Issue: Features Not Displaying

**Solution:**
1. Check features exist:
```sql
SELECT * FROM home_features;
```
2. Verify `show_features_section` is true:
```sql
SELECT show_features_section FROM home_section_settings;
```
3. Check browser console for errors

### Issue: RLS Policy Errors

**Solution:**
Run this to check policies:
```sql
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename LIKE 'home_%';
```

If policies are missing, re-run the RLS section from schema file.
